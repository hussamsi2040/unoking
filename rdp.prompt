5. Technical Requirements

5.1. Technology Stack:

Frontend: React, TypeScript

Backend: Nest.js, TypeScript

Database: MongoDB

Caching: Redis

Cloud Platform: Azure

Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO

5.2. Performance Requirements:

Concurrency: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users.

Latency: Maximum acceptable gameplay latency: 150ms (target 100ms)

Scalability: System should be able to handle increased user loads without significant performance degradation.

Response Times:

API requests should respond within 200ms.

Real-time updates should be nearly instantaneous.

5.3. System Architecture:
